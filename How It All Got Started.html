So in the mid-90s, when I opened my business, the first idea that came to mind was to make everything with an equine theme.<div><br></div><div>The horses are 100% hand-crafted and are truly unique, as I've not located a wood horse exactly like these. They are one inch thick and can stand on their own. They are offered painted only, with added mane and tail, and with added bridle and reins. And especially, those with a mane and tail, or a bridle and reins, have not been found anywhere else; they are created differently from others, but simply.</div><div><br></div><div>They are cut by hand, sanded, painted, and decorated by hand; it takes several days from cut to finished product. They are not toys; but lovingly created for decorative purposes only.</div><div><br></div><div>The signs are original in the writing. That is, as with the horses, I have not found another home accent with the use of equine terms teamed with scripture. People are loving them! Also, there are several from which to choose.</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, the horseshoes! They are only offered at Christmas (so you'll want to register your e-mail address to be one of the first to see them beginning in October). Real horseshoes (new and used) have accents like real cinnamon sticks, pine sprigs with red berries and are scented with pine*, the cutest snowman, and tiny colorful wrapped presents all "inside" the horseshoe, and are hung with red suede. They are not recommended for hanging on trees, as they are too heavy. (*Not used for those with allergies to perfumes, if noted upon ordering).</div><div><br></div><div>So, if you're searching for that one, unique gift to give a horse lover -- or just to decorate your home, RV, stable office, or regular office -- you have come to the right place! You'll get real pleasure from giving something that was hand-crafted; and they will love you for it! My short-term goal is to offer them in tack shops and western stores (that information will be in the newsletter when it happens).</div><div><br></div><div>In this age of electronics that bombard us night and day, we enjoy the simple things that take our thoughts into another direction and enable us to relax. Wood accents create a warm touch. The home accents of For Want of a Horse will do just that for you or a loved one.<br></div><div><br></div><div>... here's to home accents that you'll love forever...</div><div><br></div><div>Chandra</div></div>
